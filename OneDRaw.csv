I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen

Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

[Chorus: All]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Verse 2: Harry, Louis]
Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start


[Chorus: All]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Bridge: Zayn]
You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

[Breakdown: Liam]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

A week ago, you said to me
""Do you believe I'll never be too far?""
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we?
Ah-ooh, we had some good tricks up our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing

Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild

And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me
Anyone in-between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
